...Well.
What the heck happened HERE?

@That's what we're paying you to find out, Sherlock Holmes.

[confused] Sherlock-? [angryface] Hey. Buddy. Don't get sarcastic with me.

@Wouldn't dream of it.

...Okay.
Let's take a look around.

--------
someone tried to rob a pair of wizards. it ended in three fatalities, or so it seems- they actually killed the robber in self-defense, but then faked their own deaths to avoid an irritating police investigation, since wizardry is illegal
robber busts through the door. let's not get too fancy with this since we can't leave the apartment. 
robber has a gun
there's a list of magic spells the wizards have. two spells they can cast, and a third they can't, but it looks like they can, so there's misdirection
they wanted to make it look like their superspells backfired on them
Go Wizard:
	Portable Hole
	Reversing Rune (apply sticker to object to reverse its trajectory)
	Emergency Exit (use fire to teleport elsewhere)
Stop Wizard:
	Living Memory (project hologram of a frozen moment in time)
	Mass Arrest Momentum (stop all motion for a target or targets until they pass a constitution saving throw)
	Flesh to Stone (scribbled in margin: if target is already affected by a status effect, spell backfires on user)
so there's a statue wizard (actually just sealed in quick-drying concrete) and a shot wizard (actually just a portable hole on his chest plus fake blood)
robber busts in, fires gun. stop wizard mass-holds everyone but himself. needs to stop bullet, takes Reversing Rune sticker, uses it to reverse bullet trajectory. robber dies from own bullet.
they now need to fake their deaths, but they can't leave the building, and people are coming to check. they have to fake their deaths in place.

so what's the story here? in their fiction, the robber shot the go wizard, and then stop wizard tried to flesh-to-stone the robber, but something went wrong. the robber died somehow, and flesh-to-stone backfired.
however the robber died should obscure (but not totally hide) the bullet wound
they burned him up, but there need to be hijinx as to how it happened. let's say the emergency exit spell went out of control- killing the go wizard left the fire to go out of control. half the room is pretty badly burned. we need a way to put that out, by the way. that can be twist 2 evidence- hidden fire extinguisher
robber is on fire, attacks stop wizard, who casts flesh to stone- but since he's on fire, which counts as a status effect, it backfires. 
robber tries to escape, but succumbs to burn wounds and dies by the door. okay

IN ACTUALITY:
robber died from gunshot wound. they concocted the aforementioned story, and went about faking it and hiding the evidence. they set half the room on fire- but moved all their valuables out of the way first. they put out the fire, with an extinguisher they hid. go wizard emptied a bottle of virgin's blood on himself and then put a portable hole on the stain. stop wizard used a bucket of water to coat self in quickrete, then mass hold person'd himself and go wizard to prevent breathing

easy! okay. now that we have a story, let's build the game
your cop partner has a Guess about what's happening here- you've got to fill in the Guess with Evidence until it's complete. at that point, you get a Picture, which you Break by applying more Evidence. this unlocks a new Guess to fill in.

so his first guess is going to be the fake story.

A: "So this crook here from the hologram tried to rob these wizards, but ended up burning to death."
B: "Before the Go Wizard got shot, it looks like he tried to set himself on fire and cast Emergency Exit to escape."
C: "The Go Wizard got shot before he could finish casting, and fell over, setting the room and the robber on fire."
D: "Looks like after that, the Stop Wizard started casting all his spells. Living Memory created this illusion, and Mass Arrest Momentum trapped the crook in the fire."
E: "Then he tried to cast Flesh to Stone on the robber, to finish him off... but since the robber was on fire, it counted as a status effect, and the Stop Wizard turned to stone."

---
A: "Looks like the guy by the door, [whoever he is,] died... somehow. I'd bet dollars to donuts we'll find a [cause of death] around here somewhere."
BC: "We've also got us a dead wizard, but we don't know [what kind, 'zactly...] we'll need to figure out [cause of death] for him, too."
D: "We've got [some kinda hologram] by the door here... [where'd it come from?] Some sorta hocus pocus antics, no doubt. Blasted wizards."
E: "Oh, and there's a suspicious wizard statue sitting there. Don't know [where that's from] either. Lord knows what that's all about."

(inspecting hologram identifies hologram as wanted robber)

>apply Evidence: Hologram to [whoever he is]
	"So this crook here from the hologram tried to rob these wizards, but ended up dead somehow. There's a [cause of death,] probably."
>apply Evidence: State of the body OR Evidence: Fire at 2:35am to [cause of death,]
	"Looks like the guy by the door, [whoever he is,] ended up burning to death in the fire at 2:35. Poor guy."
>apply both
	"So this crook here from the hologram tried to rob these wizards, but ended up burning to death."

>apply Evidence: Go Spellbook (or any Evidence: spell from go spellbook) to [what kind, 'zactly...]
	"There's also a dead Go Wizard, who met an ugly end, looks like. Bet there's a [cause of death] for this guy, too."
>apply Evidence: Bleeding wound to [cause of death]
	"There's also a [dead wizard of some sort], what got shot... but did [anything else happen] to him?"
>apply Evidence: Charred robes to [cause of death]
	"There's also [some kinda wizard] who got set on fire at some point, but it doesn't look like his [cause of death] was burning."
>apply both
	"There's also a dead Go Wizard, who got shot AND got set on fire. It looks like the bullet was the cause of death."

	D3: "Looks like the Stop Wizard cast a spell here. Living Memory created this illusion."
	OBTAIN EVIDENCE: Gunfire

	E: "And there's a suspicious wizard statue sitting here. Don't know [where that's from] either."
>apply Evidence: Flesh to Stone to [where that's from]
	"And there's this wizard statue here- looks like a Stop Wizard wound up on the wrong end of his own Flesh to Stone spell. But [<i>how</i> did it backfire?]"
	OBTAIN EVIDENCE: Stop Wizard
>apply Evidence: Flesh to Stone to [how did it backfire?] (if D1: move to D3)
	"Then he tried to cast Flesh to Stone on the robber, to finish him off... but you're saying the robber already had [some kind of status effect?]"
>apply Evidence: State of the body to [how did it backfire?] (if D1: move to D3)
	"And there's this wizard statue here- looks like a Stop Wizard wound up on the wrong end of his own Flesh to Stone spell. You're saying how he died [somehow made the spell backfire?]"
>apply both 
	"Then he tried to cast Flesh to Stone on the robber, to finish him off... but since the robber was on fire, it counted as a status effect, and the Stop Wizard turned to stone."
	
"We're pretty close, here... but I don't think we have the entire picture. We need to ask some more questions."

A: "So this crook here from the hologram tried to rob these wizards, but ended up burning to death."
B: "Before the Go Wizard got shot, it looks like he tried to set himself on fire and cast Emergency Exit to escape."
C: "The Go Wizard got shot before he could finish casting, and fell over, setting the room and the robber on fire."

A*: "So this crook here from the hologram tried to rob these wizards, but ended up burning to death."
BC: "There's also a dead Go Wizard, who got shot AND got set on fire. It looks like the bullet was the cause of death.
D: "Looks like the Stop Wizard cast a spell here. Living Memory created this illusion."
E*: "Then he tried to cast Flesh to Stone on the robber, to finish him off... but since the robber was on fire, it counted as a status effect, and the Stop Wizard turned to stone."
F: But... [how did the fire start?] And [why didn't the robber escape?]


>apply Evidence: hay wires to [how did the fire start?]
	"A blaze like this needed fuel- and there were bales of hay stacked up nearby. [But how did it ignite?] And [why didn't the robber escape?]"
>apply Evidence: candle to [how did the fire start?]
	"The candle the wizard's holding probably started the fire- [but how did it spread?] And [why didn't the robber escape?]" 
>apply both
	"It looks like the wizard started the fire with the candle and hay bales. But [was it an accident, or deliberate?]"

	F: "But [why didn't the robber escape?]"
	B*: "Before the Go Wizard got shot, it looks like he tried to set himself on fire and cast Emergency Exit to escape."
	C: "It looks like it [failed somehow,] though."
>apply Evidence: Bullet wound to [failed somehow,]

>apply Evidence: Mass Arrest Momentum to [why didn't the robber escape?]
